# Natural-Language-to-Python-Code-Generator
A simple AI/ML-based Python project that converts natural language instructions into executable Python code using rule-based NLP techniques. This project demonstrates how basic natural language processing can be used to understand user intent and generate corresponding code without relying on external APIs or heavy ML frameworks.
